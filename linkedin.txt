🚀 From Challenge to Innovation: Introducing Hunter

Recently, while working on enhancing network visibility and alerting, I explored the possibility of using ntopng for advanced conditional alerting.

I even reached out to the ntopng support team with the following use case:

📌 Trigger an email alert when:

Destination ASN = 132420

Destination Port = 22 (SSH)

Time Window = 1 day

Flow Count > 1000 from a single source IP

Include contextual data (hostname, node IP, offending source IP, tenant ID)

The response was clear:
❌ "No, currently it's not available. We are planning on adding something similar, but no specific plan for now."

This limitation inspired me to develop my own solution – Hunter 🛡️

✨ Hunter at a Glance:
✔️ Detects SSH access attempts
✔️ Monitors outbound traffic & bandwidth usage
✔️ Identifies open ports & anomalies
✔️ Provides RESTful API access
✔️ High-performance analytics powered by ClickHouse
✔️ Auto ticketing + intelligent alert deduplication
✔️ Delivered as a .deb installer for easy deployment

📚 Documentation available:

Project Report

Installation Guide

Configuration Guide

🖼️ I’ll be sharing screenshots and outputs from Hunter alongside this post to show its real-world capabilities.

🔥 And here’s the exciting part:
👉 Hunter is now released as Open Source on GitHub 🎉
Built with Java + Spring Boot, anyone can clone, use, and extend Hunter for their own monitoring & alerting needs.

This is just the beginning – true innovation happens when we turn challenges into solutions 🚀
